# # String to Integer
# Implement atoi which converts a string to an integer.
# 
# The function first discards as many whitespace characters as necessary until the first non-whitespace character is found. Then, starting from this character, takes an optional initial plus or minus sign followed by as many numerical digits as possible, and interprets them as a numerical value.
# 
# The string can contain additional characters after those that form the integral number, which are ignored and have no effect on the behavior of this function.
# 
# If the first sequence of non-whitespace characters in str is not a valid integral number, or if no such sequence exists because either str is empty or it contains only whitespace characters, no conversion is performed.
# 
# If no valid conversion could be performed, a zero value is returned.
# 
# Note:
# 
# *Only the space character ' ' is considered as whitespace character.
# *Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [âˆ’2^31,  2^31 âˆ’ 1]. If the numerical value is out of the range of representable values, INT_MAX (2^31 âˆ’ 1) or INT_MIN (âˆ’2^31) is returned.
# 
# 
# Example 1
# ```
# Input: "   -42"
# Output: -42
# ```
# Example 2
# ```
# Input: -123
# Output: -321
# ```
# 
# Example 3
# ```
# Input: "4193 with words"
# Output: 4193
# ```
# 
# Example 4
# ```
# Input: "words and 987"
# Output: 0
# ```
# 
# 
# Example 5
# ```
# Input: "-91283472332"
# Output: -2147483648
