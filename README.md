# LeetCode

Iterative thinking, coding and learning!

## Why Leetcode matter for a data analyst?
LeetCode is one of the most popular online platforms to for software engineers to practice their coding skills. Even though I am a data analyst, I find it quite important to learn data structure and algorithms. This knowledge plays a crucial role in building an efficient model. Some trick and coding habits make codes easy to understand and saving memories and running time at the same time. 

## Why my solutions matter?
In this project, I focus on solving problems using python. For some of the problems, I provide multiple approaches to tackle the problem. Most of the problems run faster than 90%. 

Hope you will find my solutions useful for your journey on LeetCode :).
